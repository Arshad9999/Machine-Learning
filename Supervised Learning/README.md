Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model on labeled data, where the desired output is known, in order to make predictions on new, unseen data. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function from input variables (features) to output variables (labels) based on a set of training examples.

There are two main types of supervised learning: classification and regression.

Classification involves predicting a categorical or discrete output variable, such as whether an email is spam or not, based on a set of input features. In classification, the model is trained to assign input data to one of several predefined classes. Some common algorithms used for classification include logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVMs).

Regression involves predicting a continuous output variable, such as the price of a house, based on a set of input features. In regression, the model is trained to predict a numerical value based on the input data. Some common algorithms used for regression include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

Supervised learning has many practical applications, including image classification, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and more. In order to train a supervised learning model, a dataset with labeled examples is required. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the model trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set to measure its performance. The performance of the model is typically measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
